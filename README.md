# OpenSim-Blender-Addons
A suite of addons for importing, exporting, and animating OpenSim models in Blender.  Blender is a free, near-commercial-grade modeling and animation program.  See blender.org.

The addons are written in Python and were developed in Blender 2.74.

Each Python file (*.py) in this repository can be added as a stand-alone addon in Blender.  At this time there are no interdependencies between the files.  In Blender go to File > User Preferences and click on the Add-ons tab.  At the bottom of the Add-ons tab, click the "Install from File", brows to the location of the .py file, and open the .py file.  When you install the first OpenSim addon, an OpenSim category will be created and added to the list of addon categories in the column on the left.  You will be able to find all the installed OpenSim addons in the OpenSim category.  To make an OpenSim addon active in Blender, click the checkbox on the far right of each addon (if it is not check).

Note that addons are under development not necessarily functional at this time.
